Fitness is a bright and vibrant single page website template written in Bootstrap 4, and serves as a fantastic starting point to get you going on your next website project.

Here you can find the original [PSD](http://blazrobar.com/free-psd-website-templates/fitness-free-photoshop-psd-template/)
by [Blaz Robar](http://blazrobar.com/).

This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, Bootstrap 4, and Gulp.

Performance basics are covered: unused Bootstrap SCSS is commented out, assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.
